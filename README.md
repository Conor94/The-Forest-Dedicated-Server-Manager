# The Forest Dedicated Server Manager
This is a GUI application used to manage The Forest Dedicated Server. The Forest is a video game made by Endnight Games which provides a tool called The Forest Dedicated Server that allows running a server on a local machine or through a service provider (see https://theforest.gamepedia.com/Dedicated_Servers for more details). The provided tool has very little functionality (e.g. it doesn't provide a way to start or shutdown the server), which is why The Forest Dedicated Server Manager was created. A full list of features provided by The Forest Dedicated Server Manager are listed below in the Features section.
